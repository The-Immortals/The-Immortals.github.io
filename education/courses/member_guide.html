<h1 class="text-center">The Immortals New Member Guide</h1>
<hr />
<p>Welcome to Politics and War and to The Immortals alliance! The guide below is a
roadmap for new players to navigate the most efficient and effective ways to grow and
become a strong nation and valuable alliance member. Note that this is a guide for
what we feel is the best way forward, however, you are free to deviate from this to fit
your goals and gameplay style. Members have flexibility in how to develop, but the
main exception is in times of war, all members are expected to be active and follow
military build recommendations and attack/defense instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Nation and Financial Growth:</strong></p>
<p>Your nation score is a computation of cities, infra, projects and military – you want your
nation score to generally be as low as possible, this is counterintuitive from what you
would expect. Nations can declare wars on other nations that are 25% smaller than
them, so the bigger your score, the bigger the nations that can attack you. As you start
out, don’t be too quick to build infra in each city or a larger military than you need – this
will provide more raiding targets and keep you safer from stronger nations.</p>
<p>The number one way for new players to gain a lot of money quickly is through raiding
inactive players. A new player can generate $100M+ in the first month of the game.
Visit our Raiding Guide to learn and get started! The important thing to note is that
once you hit roughly 9+ cities, the number of available raiding targets goes way down,
to almost non-existent. Be sure you are done with your raiding days before deciding to
build cities above that level. Although not required, we recommend all new players
start out as a raider, learn the mechanics of war through this, and generate $$$ for the
future.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">Phase 1 - Raider (nations with < 9 cities):</strong></p>
<p>You want minimal infra, but maximum raiding ability. All cities have suggested builds as
follows:
            <ul>
                <li>1 power plant (oil or coal) – note that you’ll eventually go nuclear, but if you don’t
                have the money, do oil or coal for now and replace at the next phase.</li>
                <li>4 Barracks, 1 Factory, 3 Hangars, 1 Drydock (we refer this as 4,1,3,1). Tanks and
                ships are expensive and add a lot to your nation score, so as a raider you’ll want
                to minimize the use of these (refer to Raiding Guide).</li>
            </ul>
<p>Note that the above is 10 buildings, so you’ll need 500 infra/500 land in each city.
Also note that all resources you need to run your nation should be purchased on the
exchange, but if you’re raiding effectively, you’ll never have to buy anything.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">Phase 2 - Stability (nations with 9-12 cities):</strong></p>
<p>As you build more cities and are able to raid less, you’ll need a new way to generate
  income, this is through increasing your tax base. The more infra each city has, the
  bigger the population, and thus, tax revenue. This phase of growth focuses on building
  the commerce buildings to earn 100% bonus to your tax revenue and we want to do so
  by utilizing as few buildings as possible to get there. Here are the recommended builds
  for all your cities to have (again, purchase any resources needed on the exchange):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 nuclear power plant – your infra slots are more expensive the bigger your cities
            are, so 1 nuclear plant instead of 2 oil/coal is better, plus less pollution.</li>
            <li>5 Barracks, 1 Factory, 5 Hangars, 1 Drydock (this may need to be adjusted in times
            of war, in which case it may be better to replace commerce buildings rather than
            building more infra to build factories/drydocks)</li>
            <li>1 Subway</li>
            <li>3 Stadiums</li>
            <li>4 Shopping Malls</li>
            <li>4 Banks</li>
            <li>5 refineries of <strong>SAME</strong> resource (Gasolin/Munitions/Aluminum/Steel - see below)</li>
            <li>1 Police Station, 1 Hospital, 2 Recycling Centers</li>
         </ul>
<p>The above build will get you to 100% commerce and is a total of 34 buildings. In order
  to accommodate this, you will need 1,700 infra and 1,700 land in each city.</p>
<p>You’ll note that the prices fluctuate throughout the year based on supply/demand,
  much of which is dictated when there are times of war or peace around Orbis - so don’t
  let the current calculation necessarily dictate which resource to produce. However, the
  biggest takeaway is don’t produce food or raw materials, the numbers prove that it’s
  much more profitable to produce manufactured goods (gasoline, munitions, aluminum
  or steel). In times of war, those are the main resources that matter and that’s what we
  want everybody producing (and the production is taxed by the alliance and sent to
  members in time of an alliance war). Choose ONE resource and max produce that in
  every city. The reason is that there are projects that we can build that increase
  production of that single resource by about 1/3rd (doubled for gasoline) – so max
  producing the same resource in every city maximizes your revenues if you get that
  respective Project. GET THE PROJECT FOR WHAT YOU ARE MAKING
  Buy the raw materials for your manufactories and food for your nation on the exchange,
  and you can sell your manufactured goods on the exchange for a profit. You should
  come out well ahead as you maximize.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">Phase 3 - Optimized:</strong></p>
<p>TAfter you have a handle on phase 2, increasing your infra to 2,000 will have large
  benefits if you can afford to get there. Go to 2k infa/2k land build and with the extra 6
  builds you’d have, you can look to either go to 115% commerce with the International
  Trade Center, or, manufacture a 2nd resource. Note if you go that route you’ll want to
  add the 3rd recycling center and consider hospitals vs. military buildings in peace time to
  keep control on the disease. In peace time, having 0 factories or 1 less barracks in a city
  would be acceptable and in war time, changing some buildings to get to 5/5/53 will be
  necessary. However, note that in times of war, your infra can be easily destroyed and
  the alliance will not fund back to 2k – that is your nation’s investment/risk.</p>
        <!--Add image here-->
<p><strong style="color: red;">Phase 4 - Optional:</strong></p>
<p>After you have a handle on phase 3 and many more cities, you might consider bumping
up your infra/land further to maximize the fact that you have 100% commerce and
increase your tax base. While we don’t recommend going beyond 2,000 infra, if you do
want to go up to 2,000 you might consider a combination of either maxing your military
build to 5,5,5,3 (which would put you at the 40 buildings/2k infra) or going the economic
route and building the International Trade Center project to get to 115% commerce
max, and then build 5 supermarkets to do so, which would put you at 39 buildings. Just
remember that infra at that level is very expensive and takes a long time to pay for itself
– and can be wiped out very easily in war.</p>
<p><strong>Projects:</strong></p>
<p>Every 5,000 of infra that your nation has, you can build a national project. The alliance
will help fund some of these (see Grants below). Here’s the recommended order of
building projects based on the phase you are in above:</p>
       <ol>
            <li><strong>Phase I: </strong>Intelligence Agency – spies are useful in times of war and this allows you to have a
            max 60 spies instead of 50, as well as allowing you to recruit 3 spies per day
            instead of 2. You’ll want to build up your spies right away, as it takes weeks to
            have the max number. Also, spies can be useful in identifying good raiding targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase II: </strong>Propaganda Bureau – allows you to recruit 10% more military each day, which is
            very helpful in war time.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase III: </strong>Manufacturing project based on which resource you produce (Arms Stockpile,
            Bauxiteworks, Emergency Gasoline Reserve, Ironworks)</li>
            <li><strong>Phase III: </strong>Nuclear Research Facility – You will eventually be at the size where nukes become
            cost effective to utilize (refer to military guide).</li>
        </ol> 
<p><strong>Future:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>If your goal is to get to 20+ cities, you might consider the city planning projects,
              just note that the alliance will not fund them upfront due to the high cost.
              However, you will receive the same city grant funds whether you have the project
              or not, effectively paying for itself down the road.</li>
            <li>International Trade Center – as discussed in Phase 4 above.</li>
            <li>Vital Defense System – helps thwart nukes</li>
            <li>Note – not recommended to build missile launch pad or iron dome – the project
              slots are more valuable elsewhere.</li>
        </ol>
<h2 class="text-center">Grants</h2>
<hr />
<p>The alliance will fund all city builds through Phase 2 of the above plan and then caps all
  future grants at $45M. Also, most projects will be funded as requested, again, up to
  $45M. This is subject to change as the alliance bank grows – we want to maximize our
  investment in our membership. Please utilize #grant-requests in discord to request a
  grant. Pinned in the channel are the current grant rules to adhere to. If you receive a
  grant, you agree to stay in the alliance for 60 days. If you leave the alliance early, you
  are expected to pay back any grants received within the previous 60 days. The start-up
  grant is for nations below 4 cities and can be requested upon receiving the Immortal
  role. If a new member is at or above 4 cities, they must wait to request a grant as if
  their join date was their last grant. Up through city 7 you can request a grant every 7
  days and city 8-10 every 10 days. Once you hit city 10, you can request a grant every 15
  days (Note that the game does not allow you to build cities or projects in less than 10
  days at that point – we may shorten as our tax base grows).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are building a new city, you should have Manifest Destiny as your domestic
      policy. This makes city purchases 5% cheaper.</li>
    <li>If you are building a new project, you should have Technological Advancement as
      your domestic policy. This makes the project purchase 5% cheaper.</li>
    <li>If you are doing a large infra buy (a war re-build or bumping up from phase 1 to
      phase 2 or phase 2 to phase 3), you should have Urbanization as your domestic
      policy to make the infra purchase 5% cheaper.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that you can change this policy every 5 days, so plan ahead so that you have the
    right policy in place when you are planning a spend. To change your policy, go under
    the Nation section on the left side of the in-game panel and it’s under Edit.
    City grants will be paid out with the assumption that you have Manifest Destiny on and
    project grants will be paid out with the assumption you have Technological
    Advancement on.</p>
  <p><strong>Here is a list of our current grants:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Signing bonus - $1M. If you are reading this, you completed your applicant
        interview and were accepted into the alliance and given $1M. You agree to stay
        in The Immortals for a minimum of one week.</li>
      <li>Startup Grant - $3M. You can request this once you complete the Immortal
        Training Program assuming you aren’t up to city 4 yet, which you should have
        been directed to upon acceptance into the alliance. This grant should cover all
        builds up through city 4.</li>
      <li>City 5-7 Grants: You receive 100% of the funds for building the city (assuming
        Manifest Destiny policy) and wait 7 days between grant requests.</li>
      <li>City 8-10 Grants: You receive 100% of the funds for building the city (assuming
        Manifest Destiny policy) and wait 10 days between grant requests.</li>
      <li>City 13+ Grants: Capped at $45M per city at this time. The intent is that the
        bigger you become, the more revenue you will make and be able to cover a
        portion of the costs to build.</li>
      <li>Project Grants: The alliance will pay 100% of the cost of the Projects listed in
        Phase 1, 2 and 3 above (assuming Technological Advancement policy is on).
        Other Projects in the “Future” category, the alliance has the discretion to help
        fund these Projects up to $45M each, the remainder of the cost is up to you.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>War Grants:</strong></p>
   <p>If you need to replace resources lost fighting in an alliance war or counter, you can
    request cash or resources on the war grant channel, #war-aid. The intent though is that
    members build up their own war chest of resources to conduct multiple rounds of wars
    and loot gained in victory would also be factored in. Please see the Pinned Economic
    info tab in Discord for current war chest requirements.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">Partcipation/Government</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>What makes a good alliance is its community. We require everyone to log in at least
      once a day in-game to ensure any attacks you receive are getting appropriately handled
      and just to ensure you are an active member. Our current tax rate for members is 30%
      and may be adjusted in the future. However, if a member is inactive for 5 days, taxes
      will be increased to 100%. Once you return, taxes will be set back down to 30% if you
      message Econ staff, but we need to encourage activity. If you will be gone and
      communicate that through #vacation, we’ll know where you are and won’t adjust your
      taxes. If you remain inactive longer than 7 days, you may be removed from the alliance
      which does open you up to raiders. Removal for inactivity or other reasons does not
      forgive repayment of grants.</p>
    <p>We want to be flexible to allow you to play how you want, whether you are somebody
      who logs in for 5 minutes once a day, or somebody who’s on every waking minute and
      up all night dreaming about P&W. We want The Immortals to be an inviting, welcoming
      and accepting community and that community comes together through our Discord
      channel. A really good member will be on Discord at least once a day and hopefully
      chatting in there. Even discussing random topics in the public channel gets people
      talking and engaged and getting to know one another. So please consider speaking up
      as much as you can there, we want to hear from you! Also, there will be crucial
      information shared in Discord, critical to our alliance, so it’s important you check in.
      New members will be assigned a military group and we want people to be active so that
      we are effective when the time for military action comes.</p>
      <p><strong>Get Involved!</strong></p>
      <p>To run an effective alliance in the game, we need people helping the alliance – our
        government. We have positions open in every group and want players to strongly
        consider joining government. You don’t need any experience, as we have tasks to get
        people started and you can move up as you gain that experience. To entice government
        participation, we also have some positions that you can get compensated for your
        efforts. Below is a high-level summary of each group and the open positions/tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Internal Affairs (IA) – this group is tasked with the organization and inner-
            workings of the alliance. Education and training of members and recruitment of
            
            new members is the primary responsibilities. The group is also responsible for
            developing “how-to” guides in how to play the game and running the Immortal
            Training Program, as well as organizing the Discord channel which includes
            masking roles for individuals, as well as removing masks when people leave or
            change roles.</li>
          <ul> 
            <li>Open Position: IA Staff</li>
          <ul> 
            <li>Learn to conduct applicant interviews and successfully convert
              applicants to new members. Receive $100k for every successful
              member added after interview.</li>
            <li>Guide new members through the Immortal Training Program and
              how to navigate the game and Discord. Be pleasant and welcoming,
              and chat with visitors to our channel.</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Econ – this group handles the finances of the alliance and includes things such as
            safeguarding alliance funds, paying out and tracking grants/loans, conducting
            audits, adjusting member tax rates, and collections from members that leave,
            among others.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Open Position: Auditor</li>
              <ul> 
                <li>Conduct audits of existing members which entails reviewing their city
                    builds, making recommendations to help them maximize in line with
                    alliance expectations (this guide, war chest, etc). Compensation
                    includes $100k for every successful audit conducted and concluded.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Open Position: Collections Agent</li>
            <ul> 
              <li>Help with the tracking of grant funds that need to be re-paid if a
                  member leaves and contact the member that left to work out a
                  payment schedule. This could involve working with the FA group and
                  any new alliances that the leaving member joins. Compensation
                  includes a percentage of funds recovered from your efforts for
                  assigned collections (those that don’t pay immediately when asked).</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
            <li>Milcom – this group handles the military aspect of the alliance. Main
                responsibilities include conducting counter attacks from nations that attack one
                of our members or our allies, organizing military action in wars (both offensive
                and defensive) and ensuring members have the right war chests and military
                builds when needed.</li>
            <ul> 
              <li>Open Position: Fire Team Leader (or assistant)</li>
              <ul> 
                <li>Fire team leaders organize attacks by working with members within
                    their assigned group to see who is available and able to attack, and
                    coordinate an effective strike – training will be provided. This person
                    must be very active and have a good handle on the military
                    mechanics of the game. Leaders will be receive $100k for every
                    successful counter they coordinate, assistant leaders are leaders in
                    training.</li>
              </ul>
              
            </ul>
           <li> Foreign Affairs (FA) – this group handles the interactions with other alliances
