<h1 class="text-center">The Immortals Alliance Rules</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>Rules for raiding:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>First and foremost, all raids against <i>nations in any alliance</i> must 
    be approved in #raid-approvals.</li>
    <li>Raid targets must not be in an alliance that is ranked in the top 40.</li>
    <li>Targets must not be in an alliance that has a treaty with a top 40 alliance.</li>
    <li>Targets must not be in an alliance we have a treaty with.</li>
    <li>Nations that are not in an alliance may be raided at will.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Activity Level:</strong></p>
<p>You must log into your nation <i>at least</i> once a day - once a week does not
work here. You will be exposed to raiders if you are not active. If you expect to be out 
of touch for more than a day or two, let us know so we can watch over your nation. If you expect to
to be gone for a week or more, seriously consider going into vacation mode.</p>
<p>If you are not active, government members may remove you from the membership at any time. You will have to
    reapply after. We do this because people who are raided and are officially "defeated" in their wars allow their
    attackers to loot the alliance bank of its money and resources. These come from the taxes of the general
    membership so they deserve to be protected.
</p>
<p><strong>Discord:</strong></p>
<p>We expect members to check in on discord at least once a day. Even if you donâ€™t talk in discord and lurk in the
    shadows, you can see updates and what is going on in the alliance (but please speak up, we want to hear you!).
</p>
<p>
    Discord is key as it allows us to have real-time conversations with each other. It helps government members
interact with the general membership. As you can imagine, this can be extremely helpful for keeping up with
events, discussing new ideas, and coordination during a war. It's also a great place to learn from experienced
members or get help if you are attacked.
</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour when interacting with others outside the alliance:</strong></p>
<p>
    Simply, do not be rude. This means be respectful in our and another alliance's discord servers. Be respectful when
    sending messages in-game. Even if someone attacked you, be an honourable opponent. 
</p>
<p><strong>Grant repayment:</strong></p>
<p>Grants are given to members to grow the strength of the membership of our alliance. That is an investment in
    The Immortals and so if a member decides to leave after receiving a grant, we expect to receive a refund on that
    investment. If a member leaves, all grants received within the previous 60 days must be paid immediately.
    Failure to pay within 7 days will cause 5% weekly interest to be assessed and the alliance retains the right to
    military action to get the amount owed.
</p>
<br />
<p>Test your self: <i>(Try this question to help you on the test!)</i><br />
<i><strong>Can you attack a nation in the Grumpy Old Bastards alliance?</strong></i><br />

<br />
<button onclick="gradeFunction()" class ="btn btn-primary">Answer</button>
</p>
<script>
    function gradeFunction() {
        var value = document.getElementById("test").value;

        if(value == "Y" || value == "y"){
            alert("That is incorrect, Grumpy Old Bastards is an alliance in the top 40.");
        }
        else  if(value == "N" || value =="n"){
            alert("That is correct, even if you ask Milcom, permission will not be granted.");
        }
        else {
            alert("We do not know what you mean, please try again.");
        }
    }
